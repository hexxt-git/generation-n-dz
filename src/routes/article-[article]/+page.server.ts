    <h2>Quick Facts About Algeria</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Capital:</strong> Algiers</li>
        <li><strong>Population:</strong> Around 45 million</li>
        <li><strong>Languages:</strong> Arabic (official), Tamazight (national), French (widely spoken)</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Algerian Dinar (DZD)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Algeria’s history is long and layered. Originally inhabited by the Berber people (Amazigh), it was later influenced by Phoenician, Roman, and Byzantine empires. Around the 7th century, the Arabs arrived, bringing Islam and uniting the region under a new cultural and religious identity. Fast forward to the 19th century, France colonized Algeria, and it remained a French colony until 1962. That’s when Algeria won its independence after a brutal eight-year war, one of the most significant anti-colonial struggles of the 20th century.</p>

    <h2>Modern Algeria</h2>
    <p>Today, Algeria is a republic, though its political system has seen a lot of changes. The country has a mix of state-controlled and private economic sectors. It’s also rich in natural resources, especially oil and natural gas, which account for a large portion of the country’s GDP. But despite its wealth in resources, unemployment and housing issues still impact many Algerians.</p>

    <h2>Culture and Language</h2>
    <p>Algeria is a melting pot of Arab and Berber (Amazigh) cultures, with each group contributing its own traditions, languages, and customs. The Berbers have a deep-rooted history here, with a language and identity that predate Arab influence. The Tamazight language, spoken by the Berbers, got official recognition in 2002, showing Algeria’s effort to preserve this important cultural aspect.</p>
    <p>Arabic is Algeria's official language, and most Algerians speak a form of Algerian Arabic in daily life. French is also widely spoken due to Algeria’s colonial past, which means you’ll often find a unique blend of Arabic and French in everyday conversation.</p>

    <h2>Natural Landscapes</h2>
    <p>Algeria is mostly desert—about 80% of the country lies in the Sahara. But it’s not all sand dunes; the northern coast has stunning Mediterranean beaches, and the Tell Atlas mountains run parallel to the coastline, offering fertile land for agriculture. The Ahaggar Mountains in the south and the Tassili n’Ajjer plateau have incredible rock formations and prehistoric art dating back thousands of years.</p>

    <h2>Cuisine</h2>
    <p>Algerian cuisine is a mix of Mediterranean, Arabic, and Berber influences. Traditional dishes often include couscous, lamb or chicken stews, and fresh vegetables. A popular dish you’ll hear about is <em>couscous</em>, which is usually served with lamb or beef and vegetables. There's also <em>chakhchoukha</em>, a mix of shredded flatbread with a spicy tomato-based stew. For something sweet, Algerians love <em>makroud</em>, a pastry filled with dates and often soaked in honey.</p>
